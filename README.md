# StudentDAO Internship Listings

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) smart contract platform built on the Aptos blockchain for managing verified internship opportunities through community governance and economic incentives.

## Description

StudentDAO Internship Listings is a blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes how internship opportunities are posted, verified, and managed. The platform leverages the power of decentralized governance to ensure that only legitimate internship listings are available to students.

### Key Features

**Stake-to-Post Mechanism**: Companies must stake AptosCoin tokens to post internship listings, creating economic accountability and reducing spam or fraudulent postings.

**Community Validation**: The platform employs a community-driven voting system where members can validate internship listings, ensuring quality and authenticity.

**DAO Treasury Management**: All stakes are collected in a decentralized treasury, creating a sustainable economic model for platform governance and operations.

**Transparent Governance**: All listing activities, votes, and treasury operations are recorded on the blockchain, providing complete transparency and immutability.

### How It Works

1. **Listing Creation**: Companies stake a predetermined amount of AptosCoin to create an internship listing with company name and position details
2. **Community Voting**: DAO members vote on listings to validate their legitimacy and quality
3. **Automated Validation**: Listings with insufficient votes (below threshold of 10) are automatically deactivated
4. **Treasury Management**: Stakes are managed through a decentralized treasury system

### Code Example

**Creating an Internship Listing:**
```move
// Company creates a new internship listing by staking tokens
public fun create_listing(
    company: &signer,
    company_name: String,
    position: String,
    stake_amount: u64
) {
    // Withdraw stake from company's account
    let stake = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(company, stake_amount);
    
    // Create listing with initial state
    let listing = InternshipListing {
        company_name,
        position,
        stake_amount,
        is_active: true,
        votes: 0,
    };
    
    // Store listing and manage treasury
    move_to(company, listing);
}
```

**Community Validation:**
```move
// Community members vote to validate listings
public fun vote_on_listing(
    voter: &signer,
    listing_owner: address,
    vote_weight: u64
) acquires InternshipListing {
    let listing = borrow_global_mut<InternshipListing>(listing_owner);
    
    // Add community vote
    listing.votes = listing.votes + vote_weight;
    
    // Automatic validation check
    if (listing.votes < 10) {
        listing.is_active = false;  // Deactivate if insufficient votes
    };
}
```
